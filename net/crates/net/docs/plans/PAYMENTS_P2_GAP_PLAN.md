# Implementation Plan: Payments P2 — Gap burn-down (SVM parity, native gate)

**Implements:** the support-matrix gaps left standing after P1 + the 2026-07-06 review burn-down (`CODE_REVIEW_2026_07_06_PAYMENTS_SDK.md` — all H/M findings fixed on `payments-sdk`, merged to master). **xrpl is explicitly out of scope** — it stays on the ladder behind its own gate (no pinned scheme spec at `087922a5`; see `PAYMENTS_P1_NETWORK_LADDER.md`).

**The P2 sentence:** close the asymmetries — Solana rises from receipt-trust to independently-checked, the outbound HTTP door speaks every scheme the mesh flow speaks, and an announced price is *always* an enforced price, on every serving path.

---

## Status (2026-07-07): **COMPLETE** — all four workstreams landed on `net-payments-gap`

| WS | Landed | Commit | Key tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — SVM checker | ✅ | `24e6c3ac5` | `tests/svm_checker.rs` (4), `the_recorded_settle_payer_reaches_the_checker_when_the_payload_names_none` |
| B — Solana HTTP door | ✅ | `0cc67608f` | `a_solana_demand_settles_under_policy_through_the_svm_signer`, `a_solana_reject_keeps_the_reservation` |
| C — native price enforcement | ✅ | `4bf0305d1` | `a_priced_local_tool_enforces_payment_before_the_invoker`, `publish_tools_pricing_guards_fail_closed`, `a_priced_descriptor_is_refused_on_the_ungated_serve_path` |
| D — scheme readiness pinned | ✅ | `a5924020e` | `an_unknown_scheme_accepts_entry_fails_closed_at_selection` |

Every acceptance criterion below is met (per-workstream **Landed** notes record what building actually surfaced, including two discoveries the plan did not anticipate). Full payments suite, 272 MCP-adapter tests, SDK tool suites, and the core build are green.

### Post-completion addendum (2026-07-08)

**Merged to master** (PR #519) after a review burn-down that hardened this plan's work in place: the payment gate now survives `publish_tools` **refresh** (`4df531633` — a real hole WS-C's first cut missed), the SVM checker **refuses an unbound settlement outright** (`535a890e3` — stronger than WS-A's settle-time-payer fallback description below), delivered nets same-owner debits (`235adee7d`), balance parsing is scoped to relevant accounts (`a01fb7142`), the XRPL checker pins `api_version` and rejects unauthorized tags (`34140dec5`, `2923e6db6`), and the checker transport / namespace list / opaque-blob authoring were single-sourced (`8ec0befd6`, `7432fa55a`, `e44058076`).

**Extended by the N-series follow-ups** (branch `net-payments-gap-2`):

- **N2 (`0f585a834`)** landed WS-C's deliberately-unbuilt "Best" variant: `Mesh::serve_tool_paid` + `net_sdk::tool_payment` (gate trait, wire constants single-sourced — net-mcp's now re-point to the SDK's) + `EngineToolPaymentGate` in net-payments. Priced native tools no longer require the MCP adapter; the matrix's "✅ every path" cell now includes a third sanctioned serving path, not just refusal.
- **N3a (`20742d176`)** landed the carried eip155 `AuthorizationUsed` nonce bind (see Carried below). *(Hardened by the review pass — N-1/N-2 below: the bind engaged only for `0x`-prefixed nonces, and the caller-signed reference was read scheme-blind.)*
- **N3b (`7de7f13e2`)** closed the SVM co-sign residual the merge's `acd8a89cc` had scoped as deferred: attribution now requires a parsed payer→merchant transfer edge (outer or CPI-inner); delivered stays delta-derived. *(Hardened by N-3 below: the first cut bound edge **existence**, not amount, so a zero/dust decoy edge re-opened the residual; attribution now requires the payer→merchant edge sum to **cover** the delivered delta.)*

**Reviewed and hardened** (`net-payments-gap-2`, 2026-07-08): an xhigh-effort review pass over the N-series diff (three independent finders + adversarial verify) found ten items, all fixed in place — two of them real fail-open holes *inside* the N-series features themselves. Full detail lives in [`docs/misc/CODE_REVIEW_2026_07_08_PAYMENTS_GAP_2.md`](../misc/CODE_REVIEW_2026_07_08_PAYMENTS_GAP_2.md); the load-bearing fixes:

- **N-1 (`fa9d4665f`)** — `is_nonce_hex` required a literal `0x` prefix while the settlement signer's `decode_bytes32` accepts a bare-hex nonce; a bare-hex nonce silently skipped the N3a bind (fail-open, back to the weaker `(token, from, to)` check). Now prefix-optional, with a regression whose load-bearing assertion is that the bind still fires when `AuthorizationUsed` is absent.
- **N-2 (`c88f3ef38`)** — the reference precedence read `payload.authorization.nonce` for *all* schemes, but off-EVM payloads sign only their wallet blob; a caller could inject an unsigned nonce to override exact-XRPL's provider-authored `invoiceId`. The read is now scoped to eip155 networks (the only family whose checker consumes a nonce reference, and where the nonce is caller-signed).
- **N-3 (`b14e68efa`)** — SVM attribution bound edge existence, not amount (see N3b note above).
- **N-4…N-10 (`8b5e754d7`, `c435e6ae0`, `8f5f45d8a`, `7786fa741`, `1fda0d180`, `ce2ac28e8`, `2019a158a`)** — one documented fail-closed constraint (eip155 `AuthorizationUsed` emitter == asset) and six cleanups: single-sourced the engine-redeem mapping across the native + MCP gates, corrected the `Cargo.toml` event signature, dropped a dead payer fallback, scoped the SVM edge map to the merchant, computed the `Transfer` topic instead of memorizing it, and de-linked the ungated `tool_payment` module doc.

Full `net-payments` suite + SDK `tool_serve_paid` + both gate feature paths (`mesh`, `mcp-gate`) green; `cargo clippy --lib` and `cargo doc --no-default-features` clean.

**The state that was fixed (as verified 2026-07-06) — all ❌ cells now ✅:**

| Axis | eip155 `exact` | solana `exact` | native `serve_rpc` tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provider engine + mesh caller flow | ✅ | ✅ | n/a |
| Independent checker (`confirmed(n)`/`final`) | ✅ `checker/eip155.rs` | ~~❌ capped at `observed`~~ → ✅ `checker/svm.rs` (WS-A) | n/a |
| Outbound HTTP-402 door | ✅ | ~~❌ eip155-only~~ → ✅ (WS-B) | n/a |
| Payment enforced before serve | ✅ (engine redeem + MCP wrap gate) | ✅ (same) | ~~❌ discovery-only~~ → ✅ every path (WS-C) |

Money-path invariants inherited unchanged: non-custodial, keys never cross the language boundary, no arbitrary signing oracle, byte-preservation, fail-closed on every error arm, "config, not code" for network variation.

## Workstream A — SVM independent chain checker (`checker/svm.rs`)

The one gap that caps confidence. A facilitator receipt justifies `observed`, full stop (P1 survey fact 2); Solana settlements today can never rise above it because `src/checker/` has only the `eip155` adapter. Solana actually makes this *easier* than EVM: `finalized` commitment is deterministic rooted finality — no depth arithmetic, no `final_depth` posture question.

- [x] `SvmChecker` implementing the P1 `ChainChecker` trait verbatim (the trait must not change — same acceptance discipline as WS1/P1), behind the existing `http-facilitator` feature, JSON-RPC against a config-pack endpoint
- [x] Verdict mapping (chain semantics *into* the fixed tier vocabulary, nothing leaks upward):
  - signature not found (`getSignatureStatuses` with `searchTransactionHistory: true`) → `Pending`
  - `meta.err != null` → `Reverted`
  - `confirmationStatus: "processed"` → `Pending` (no confidence claim — same doctrine as the eip155 missing-receipt arm)
  - `confirmationStatus: "confirmed"` → `Confirmed(n)` (n from `confirmations` / slot depth)
  - `confirmationStatus: "finalized"` → `Final` (deterministic; `final_depth` config is deliberately unused by this adapter — document it)
- [x] Delivered-amount cross-check from `getTransaction` (jsonParsed, `maxSupportedTransactionVersion: 0`) token-balance deltas: delivered = Σ positive `postTokenBalances − preTokenBalances` for `(mint == query.token, owner == query.to)` — the amount **delivered**, straight from the chain, robust through CPI
- [x] **Payer binding (H3 parity is non-negotiable):** a delta toward `pay_to` counts only when `query.from` (the authorized payer, threaded by the engine since `49c2782b6`) shows a negative delta for the same mint in the same transaction — a stranger's payment to the same merchant must sum to an honest zero, exactly as on eip155
- [x] **Genesis-hash confirmation (M7 parity):** one-shot `getGenesisHash` check that the endpoint's hash prefix matches the CAIP-2 reference (`solana:5eykt4…`) before trusting any status — the eip155 `ensure_chain_id` twin; plus the same bounded-body read (`MAX_RPC_BODY`) and retryable/terminal error mapping
- [x] Config pack: `cdp_solana_mainnet` gains `rpc_endpoints` and a `required_tier` (propose `Confirmed(1)` serve-gate default, mirroring Base) — the pack's "no checker yet, so no promises" comment retires
- [x] Amount domain note: SPL amounts are u64 raw units in a decimal string — parses through the existing `AtomicAmount` grammar; the eip155 `parse_hex_u128` overflow concern has no SVM analogue
- [x] Tests: scripted-RPC fixture (the `eip155_checker.rs` `RpcFixture` idiom) covering the verdict map, delivered extraction, **wrong-payer zero**, genesis-hash mismatch refusal; `checker_verification.rs`-style engine integration (tier upgrade → bill at required tier; revert → invalidate+freeze); adversarial rows re-run for SVM (receipt replay across quotes, network confusion, delivered mismatch)

**Acceptance:** an SPL settlement reaches `Verified@Final` through the *unchanged* engine and `re_verify_with_checker`; a facilitator pointing at a different customer's transfer to the same merchant is invalidated on the amount-mismatch arm; the Solana pack passes the same conformance shape as Base.

> **Landed** (`24e6c3ac5`), with one discovery the plan missed: exact-SVM payloads are opaque wallet blobs — **no `authorization.from` for the engine to thread**, so the H3-parity payer bind would have been inert on the very scheme it was built for. Resolution: the engine's completion events now record the facilitator's **settle-time payer claim** as a chain fact (`payer` extra), and `re_verify_with_checker` falls back to it when the payload names no payer. Weaker than the caller-signed bind (which wins when present), honestly documented at both sites — it pins post-hoc transaction substitution to the originally-named payer. Payer binding on SVM is *transaction-level* (balances carry no per-log `from`): delivery counts only when the queried payer's mint balance decreased in the same tx. `Confirmed(1)` adopted as the pack's serve tier. *(Superseded 2026-07-08: the merge's `535a890e3` made an unbound SVM settlement a hard refusal — the fallback never silently degrades to recipient-only binding — and N3b added the per-transfer payer→merchant edge on top of the delta bind; see the addendum.)* The plan's "adversarial rows re-run for SVM" resolves as: the engine-level rows (receipt replay, network confusion, delivered mismatch) are scheme-agnostic and already covered trait-generically by `checker_verification.rs`; the SVM-specific adversarial surface (wrong payer, wrong chain, fetch race, case-twiddled base58) is covered by the new fixture rows.

## Workstream B — Solana on the outbound HTTP-402 door (`flow/http402.rs`)

The mesh flow authors exact-SVM payloads; the HTTP door's `can_settle` + `author_payload` never grew the arm. Pure parity work — no new seams.

- [x] `can_settle`: namespace match widens to `eip155 | solana` (mirroring `flow/mod.rs`), still gated on a configured `SchemeSigner` for the namespace
- [x] `author_payload`: add the exact-SVM arm — `exact_svm::transfer_intent(requirements)` → `signer.sign_svm_transfer(&intent)` → `exact_svm::payload_object` (verbatim the mesh-flow dispatch; wallet owns key, SPL machinery, and blockhash)
- [x] Retry honesty carried over: the wallet may bind a fresh blockhash, so same-quote payload bytes can differ — irrelevant on this path (HTTP has no provider-side idempotency; one `fetch_paid` = one attempt, already documented), but say so at the arm
- [x] Ride-along cleanup (review LOW): `exact_svm::transfer_intent` accepts a reference-less `solana` network outside the carry path — validate CAIP-2 shape at the intent builder
- [x] All H2/M1-era hardening applies automatically (redirect refusal, origin re-check, cleartext refusal, bearer-scheme reservation retention — all live in the shared path, not per-scheme); add one solana-accepts fixture case to `http402_outbound.rs` with a stub `ExternalSvmSigner` proving policy holds before signing and the reservation survives a claimed reject

**Acceptance:** `fetch_paid` against a fixture demanding `exact`/`solana:…` settles under the same spend policy, with nothing signed before policy clears; the eip155 tests are untouched.

> **Landed** (`0cc67608f`) as planned — pure parity, no deviations. The `PaidServer` fixture grew a configurable accepts entry; the settle test also proves the wallet was shown the structured intent (mint/payTo/amount/feePayer derived from the demand, never caller-supplied) and the M1 bearer-scheme reservation retention holds on this path.

## Workstream C — native tools: announced price ⇒ enforced price

The review's "trap" (LOW, documented at `sdk/src/tool.rs` for now): `.pricing_terms()` on a `ToolDescriptor` announces a price, but the redeem gate (`PaymentAdmission`) lives only in the MCP wrap path — a natively `serve_rpc`'d tool would *look* priced while serving free. The fix is not a second gate implementation; `publish_tools` (P2-A1) already routes native tools through `WrapInvokeHandler`, which carries the `PaymentAdmission` seam. The work is closing the unguarded path and proving the guarded one.

- [x] **Prove the guarded path:** a native tool published via `publish_tools` with `pricing` + `payment_admission` in its `WrapConfig` is payment-gated end-to-end — quote redeemed before the invoker runs, unpaid caller refused (`ERR_PAYMENT`), M5's `PricingKeyUnmatched` and the priced-without-gate guard both fire for native tools exactly as for wrapped ones (they live in `publish_server`'s shared path — verify, don't reimplement)
- [x] **Close the raw path:** announcing `pricing_terms` through bare `serve_rpc`/`announce` without an admission-wired publication is refused at announce time (fail-closed, the M5 pattern: loud error naming the fix — "publish paid tools via publish_tools with payment_admission"), not silently discovery-only
  - ~~Decision to make at build~~ **Resolved: hard refusal.** `Mesh::serve_tool` / `serve_tool_streaming` return the new `ServeError::UnenforceablePricing` (core enum, additive — no exhaustive matches in-repo; the Python binding ships empty pricing by design and is unaffected)
- [x] Retire the "discovery-only" escape-hatch doc on `ToolDescriptor::pricing_terms` once the refusal lands (the doc comment was the stopgap, `2f8317dec`)
- [x] M6 parity: the caller-side gateway already forces `AtMostOnce` for paid invokes (`1128807a5`) — confirm the native invoke path flows through the same `gated_invoke`/`InvokeSafety` derivation, add the assert to its test
- [x] Tests: native paid tool via `publish_tools` — unpaid invoke refused, paid invoke redeems exactly once, replayed quote refused; raw `serve_rpc` + `pricing_terms` → structured refusal at announce

**Acceptance:** there is no code path on which a tool can be discovered as priced and invoked unpaid; the negative test proves the raw path refuses loudly.

> **Landed** (`4bf0305d1`), with the plan's central assumption **half-wrong in the dangerous direction**: `publish_tools` routed native tools through `WrapInvokeHandler` (which *carries* the `PaymentAdmission` seam) but never wired it — no priced-without-gate guard, no pricing-key check, and no `.with_payment(...)` on the handler. "Verify, don't reimplement" became *wire, then verify*: `publish_tools` now mirrors `publish_server` (both guards + per-tool `.with_payment`), accepts pricing from `WrapConfig.pricing` (folded into the lowering context) or a caller-built context, and refuses two disagreeing maps with the new `WrapError::PricingSourceConflict` rather than silently picking one. The e2e proves the unpaid call is refused *before the invoker runs*, the paid call redeems its quote through the gate, and an unpriced sibling in the same publication stays free. One scope note: "replayed quote refused" is the engine's redeem-once guarantee (`redemption_admits_a_paid_quote_exactly_once`, engine-level and path-agnostic) — the native e2e proves the gate is *consulted*, not re-proving the engine. M6 parity needed no new code: `gated_invoke` derives `AtMostOnce` from `pricing_terms`/`payment_proof` regardless of publish path (asserted since `1128807a5`). *(Extended 2026-07-08: the refusal-only raw path grew its sanctioned sibling — `Mesh::serve_tool_paid`, N2 — and the merge's `4df531633` carried the gate through `refresh`; see the addendum.)*

## Workstream D — scheme-family readiness (non-`exact`), deferred with entry criteria

Not built in P2 — the deferral is the deliverable, P1-style. `exact` is the only scheme with a pinned spec shape at `087922a5`; `upto`/dynamic pricing remain immature upstream (P1 non-goal "RFQ/dynamic pricing waits on x402 v2 maturity" stands).

- [x] Record the seam inventory a new scheme must instantiate (this list, kept next to the code): a `schemes/<name>.rs` authoring module (typed-intent in, payload object out; no raw signing), a `SchemeSigner` operation, `can_settle` arms (mesh + HTTP door — WS-B makes them symmetric), replay-identity semantics for the `consumed` index (M2: what is this scheme's nonce?), amount-policy semantics (under/over/exact — `upto` changes the `Ordering::Greater` arm from Exception to serve-at-delivered, a *money-policy decision* that goes to review, not a code detail), and checker delivered-amount semantics
- [x] Entry criteria to unshelve: scheme spec pinned at a commit; a live facilitator advertising the `(scheme, network)` kind in `GET /supported`; the amount-policy review above resolved
- [x] Until then: an accepts[] entry with an unknown scheme keeps failing closed at selection (`can_settle` → structured Denied) — already the behavior; add one pinning test naming a hypothetical `upto` entry so the refusal is a recorded contract, not an accident

**Acceptance:** the refusal-of-unknown-schemes test pins today's behavior; the seam inventory is committed prose.

> **Landed** (`a5924020e`): the seam inventory + entry criteria live next to the code (`src/x402/schemes/mod.rs` module doc — six seams, three criteria, the `upto` amount-policy review called out as the money-path decision). The pinning test drives an `upto` accepts entry on an *enabled* network with a *configured* signer and asserts the structured no-settleable `Denied` with nothing signed, sent, or reserved. *(Criteria watch, 2026-07-08: the live x402.org `/supported` now advertises `upto` and `batch-settlement` kinds on Base Sepolia — the facilitator-kind leg of the entry criteria is live upstream; the pinned-spec and amount-policy-review legs still gate. Recorded in the ladder's rung-1 run.)*

---

## Rollout order

1. **A** and **C** in parallel (independent surfaces: checker vs. publication path) — A is the long pole and the highest-value unlock (real confidence tiers for a live mainnet network); C is small and closes a stated trap.
2. **B** after A's fixture idioms exist (it reuses the stub-signer + fixture patterns), though it only depends on A socially, not technically.
3. **D** is prose + one test; ride it with whichever lands last.

> **As executed:** sequentially A → B → C → D (single implementer; the A∥C parallelism was a team-shaped option). B did reuse A's fixture idioms as predicted; C grew beyond "verify" (see its Landed note) but stayed inside its acceptance.

## Carried alongside (adjacent, not gating)

- Python surface for the outbound HTTP-402 client (ladder carry-over; still pending) — grows naturally after WS-B so the surface exposes both schemes at once.
- TS parity waits on the node binding growing a payment flow (demand-driven, unchanged).
- ~~Nonce binding in the eip155 checker via `AuthorizationUsed`~~ — **landed 2026-07-08** (N3a, `20742d176`): the caller-signed EIP-3009 nonce threads as the `TransferQuery` reference and the receipt must carry the token's `AuthorizationUsed(authorizer, nonce)` event; sha3 rides the `http-facilitator` feature (the keccak-home question resolved itself), the topic hash is computed at runtime from the event signature, and the fixture recomputes it independently.
- A **live** SVM conformance run (real Solana RPC + CDP facilitator, env-gated `#[ignore]`, same posture as P1's live suite) has not been executed — WS-A's coverage is fixture-first by design; run it at Solana enablement time alongside the P1 ladder's re-verify-at-enablement step. *(The eip155 rung's keyless live half — 1a/1b against x402.org — ran 2026-07-08 and passed; see the ladder.)*

## Non-goals (P2)

xrpl (its ladder gate stands — no pinned scheme spec, registry entries deliberately unshipped), inbound HTTP-402 serving, building any non-`exact` scheme (WS-D defers with criteria), refunds/disputes beyond the reserved object, additional networks beyond the P1 survey table, CLI/UI surfaces.

## Risks

| Risk | Containment |
|---|---|
| SVM token-balance semantics (ATAs, multiple accounts per owner, CPI-internal transfers) miscount `delivered` | Deltas keyed on `(mint, owner)` — the owner field is the wallet, not the ATA; fixture rows for multi-account and CPI cases; the exact counting rules are pinned in the module doc before build, reviewed as money-path |
| Payer-binding rule too strict/loose on SVM (fee payer ≠ token payer; wrapped-SOL edge) | The bind is on the *token* delta of `query.from`, never the fee payer; wrapped/native SOL is out of registry scope (USDC only) — absence from the allowlist is a hard reject |
| Public Solana RPC rate limits / instability destabilize conformance | Fixture-first CI (scripted RPC, the eip155 idiom); live runs env-gated `#[ignore]`, never required — same posture as P1 |
| Closing the raw `pricing_terms` path breaks an unknown consumer | Verified no live native paid-invoke path exists today; the refusal error names the supported path; change is announce-time-loud, never a silent behavior shift |
| `Confirmed(n)` semantics differ across chains (slot depth vs. block depth) confuse per-capability tier policy | `n` is documented per adapter; policy compares tiers, not raw n across networks; pack defaults reviewed per network |
| Scope creep toward new schemes/networks | WS-D's entry criteria are the gate; the P1 survey table remains the network universe |
